      <h1>Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming</h1>
      <p>
        Just like with any other activity,the world of coding is also governed
        by informal rules.Most of the rules are formulated over
        decades.Programming languages often remain the usage for longer than
        their founders expect.

        Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for

        the fluid zone called coding, Normally, a great code has three common
        features:maintainablity, dependablity and usablity. It should also be
        adaptable enough to be efficient even in changing enviroment. However,
        before coding even begins, a few prerequsite need to be fullfilled in
        order to provide a solid foundation on which readable code be written,
