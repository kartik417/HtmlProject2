      <h1>Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming</h1>
      <p>
        Just like with any other activity,the world of coding is also governed
        by informal rules.Most of the rules are formulated over
        decades.Programming languages often remain the usage for longer than
        their founders expect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for
        different purpose.Thus, some static do's and dont's are always of use in
        the fluid zone called coding, Normally, a great code has three common
        features:maintainablity, dependablity and usablity. It should also be
        adaptable enough to be efficient even in changing enviroment. However,
        before coding even begins, a few prerequsite need to be fullfilled in
        order to provide a solid foundation on which readable code be written,
      </p>
      <h2>PREREQUSITES</h2>
      <p>
        This is easily the most important step of all.In absence of this, cod
        may be inefficient even it is completed. The prerequsite that need to be
        in place for an efficient code covers matter like design and
        architecture. An important question is how development is structured.
        What is specific purpose of software?The problem that the code is meant
        to solve must be clear to the developer. What is th design of individual
        components? Such basic requirements have to be fullfilled when a good
        code is written.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once these are met, it becomes easier to follow some established good
        coding practice.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><h2>COMMENTING</h2></li>
        <p>
          Commenting is one of the technique that is often ignored by
          programmers,especially for the code that is written fo multiple
          programmers. However comment reduce the cost of knowledge transfer.
          Name of the module, purpose of the module, description of module,
          original author, modifications and authors who modified code with a
          description on why it was modified were components of early commenting
          practice.
        </p>
        <li><h2>GOOD NAMEING CONVENTIONS</h2></li>
        <p>
          Use good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often
          developers use X1 or Y1 as variables and then donot repace them with
          meaningful names. To prevent this confusion and utter waste of time,
          descriptive names should be used.
        </p>
        <li>
          <h2>DEPLOYMENT</h2>
          <p>
            Once code has been written, it has to be deployed.The installation
            files should be kept to a minimum ans update regularly. Unused code
            or anything that is not necessary should not be instslled.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The best practice foe coding are, most of all, designed to reduce risk when there are chances of it. For a beginner, few of this will not be completely applicable. But a hard boiled programmer writing numerous codes, all these guidlines will come
      in handy. Since code can run milllions of lines at times, oudated advise like 'keep it simple' or 'less is more' is priceless and should always be rembered.</p>
